								<h4>Project Description</h4>
								<p>
									A game that 3 others and I programmed for our class. We were supposed to demonstrate use of OOP in the form of a game. Frooper was our take on the popular game of Frogger, although we hit a few road bumps and couldn't get the game working as we wanted. We also didn't keep the same roles as planned, swapping them around.
