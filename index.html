					Introduction
				</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Brian Lam and I'm currently an undergraduate student at UC Merced. I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree here in Computer Science and Engineering. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On my Github, you'll probably find my high school work and some of the group projects I worked on while at UC Merced. I'm also using it just as a place to store some personal projects and try to keep it updated.
